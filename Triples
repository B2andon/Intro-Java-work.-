//I tried multiple different ways to combine the arguments/conditions into one if statemooknt / multiple, but I was either missing numbers or they weren't even shifting so the only way for me to get the shifting positions to work is to have them duplicate, I really like java regardless, and since i'm such a newbie at it, I am really happy with how much more I understand though just from a semesters worth of work so far.
